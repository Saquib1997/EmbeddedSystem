## 1.) What is Board Support Package?
* A board support package (BSP) is a collection of software components that are specific to a particular hardware platform. It is used to provide a software interface between the hardware platform and the operating system or other software that is running on it.
* A BSP typically includes device drivers and other software components that are required to support the hardware peripherals and devices on the platform. It may also include bootloaders, libraries, and utilities that are needed to support the platform's hardware and software components.
* BSPs are commonly used in embedded systems, where the hardware platform may be customized for a specific application or use case. They allow software developers to focus on developing their application or system, rather than worrying about the low-level details of the hardware platform.
* BSPs are typically provided by the hardware manufacturer or a third party, and are often specific to a particular version of an operating system or other software platform.

## 2.) Can you name some software components that are included in BSP?
Here are some common software components that may be included in a board support package (BSP):
* __Device drivers:__ These are software components that enable the operating system or other software to communicate with and control the hardware peripherals and devices on the platform. Device drivers may be included for various types of hardware, such as processors, memory, storage devices, networking devices, and other peripherals.
* __Bootloaders:__ These are small programs that are responsible for booting the operating system or other software on the platform. They may be responsible for loading the operating system from storage, configuring the hardware, and starting the operating system's kernel.
* __Libraries:__ These are collections of reusable code that can be used by other software programs. Libraries may be included in a BSP to provide support for specific hardware or software features, or to provide utility functions that are commonly needed by software developers.
* __Utilities:__ These are programs that perform specific tasks or functions that are useful for software development or system administration. Utilities may be included in a BSP to provide tools for configuring the hardware, debugging software, or performing other tasks.
* __Documentation:__ A BSP may include documentation and other resources that provide information about the hardware platform and its features, as well as guidance on how to use the BSP to develop software for the platform.

## 3.) What is Kernel?
* The kernel is the central component of an operating system that manages the hardware and software resources of the system. It acts as an intermediary between the hardware and the software that runs on the system, providing a common interface that allows the operating system and other software to access and control the hardware.

## 4.) What are the operations and tasks performed by kernel?
The kernel is the central component of an operating system that is responsible for managing the hardware and software resources of the system. It performs a wide range of tasks, including the following:
* __Resource allocation:__ The kernel is responsible for allocating and managing the system's resources, such as memory, CPU time, and other hardware resources. It controls access to these resources and ensures that they are used efficiently.
* __Process and task management:__ The kernel is responsible for creating, scheduling, and terminating processes and tasks on the system. It determines which processes and tasks should be run, and allocates the necessary resources to them.
* __Memory management:__ The kernel is responsible for managing the system's memory and ensuring that it is used efficiently. It may use techniques such as virtual memory and paging to allow the system to run programs that are larger than the available physical memory.
* __Device and file system management:__ The kernel is responsible for managing the system's devices and file systems. It provides interfaces for accessing and manipulating devices and files, and controls access to them.
* __Networking:__ The kernel is responsible for managing the system's networking functions, including sending and receiving network packets, and routing them to the appropriate destination.
* __Security:__ The kernel is responsible for enforcing security measures on the system, such as user and file permissions, and protecting the system from unauthorized access or malicious software.

## 5.) What is file system and what are different types of file system?
A file system is a way of organizing and storing files on a storage device, such as a hard drive or SSD. It provides a logical structure for storing and organizing files, and defines how the files are named, stored, and accessed.
There are many different types of file systems, each with its own set of features and capabilities. 

__Some common types of file systems include:__
* FAT (File Allocation Table): This is a simple file system that was commonly used on floppy disks and early versions of Windows. It is still used today on some removable storage devices, such as USB drives and SD cards.
* NTFS (New Technology File System): This is a modern file system that is used by Windows. It supports features such as file compression, encryption, and large file sizes.
* ext (extended file system): This is a file system that is commonly used on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It supports features such as large file sizes and permissions, and has been widely adopted as the standard file system for many Linux distributions.
* HFS (Hierarchical File System): This is a file system that is used by macOS and other Apple products. It supports features such as file compression and large file sizes.
* Btrfs (B-tree file system): This is a newer file system that is designed for modern storage devices and supports features such as data integrity, snapshots, and online filesystem resizing. It is commonly used on Linux systems.

## 6.) User Space, Kernel Space and Difference between them?
### a.) What is User Space:
* User space is the portion of memory that is allocated to user programs and processes.
* It is the memory space in which user programs are executed and stored.

### b.) What is kernel space:
* Kernel space is the portion of memory that is reserved for the kernel.
* The kernel is the central component of the operating system that manages the hardware and software resources of the system.
* The kernel runs in kernel space, and has access to all of the system's hardware and software resources.

### c.) Differences between user space and kernel space:
* User space is considered to be less privileged than kernel space.
* User programs and processes do not have direct access to the kernel or the hardware resources of the system.
* They must request access to these resources through system calls or other interfaces provided by the kernel.
* The separation of user space and kernel space helps to ensure the stability and security of the system by limiting the privileges of user programs and processes.
