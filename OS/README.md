## Embedded Operating systems

***

## Tools

- Typora
- Shutter
- Voko Screening
- Draw IO
- Visual Studio Code

---

## C

- Header file => It contains declaration of function
- Library => It contains defination of the function

- Declaration => Function prototype
- Defination

---

## Libraries

- Static library (.a) => Utility used to create it is archive
- Dynamic library (.so) => Utility used to create it is gcc -shared -L.

- While using the libraries => -lname_of_library, -Lpath_of_library

---

## PID and PPID

- getpid()
- getppid()

---

## Concepts
- Address space
- Kernel space
- User space

- Segmentation and Debugging a code
- PCB(Process Control Block) => Data structure to hold the information about the process.

---

## System calls vs Library calls
- open, read, write, close
## Fork

## Pipes

## FIFO

---

## Process States 
- Create
- Ready
- Running
- Waiting
- Exit

---

## Threads
- MultiThreading
- Use manual pages of any predefined function to check out its arguments, return type and the working
- For threads API we use, **man pthread_create** 

---

## Multi *
- Batch OS
- Multiprogramming OS
- Multitasking OS
- Multiprocessor OS
- Multiuser OS

---

## Valgrind

## Exec API

---

## Synchronization
- RaceCondition
- Shared Resources
- Critical Section
- Methods to avoid RaceCondition

---

## Synchronization Techniques
### 1. Mutex
### 2. Semaphore
### 3. Spinlocks
